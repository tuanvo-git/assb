#CPU option
srun --account=[1] --nodes=[2] --ntasks-per-node=[3] --gres=[9] --output=out.%j --error=err.%j --time=[4]:[5]:[6] --partition=[7] $[8]

[1] project name
[2] number of nodes, i.e. roughly speaking, number of "personal computer" or "laptop". Note that one node in Supercomputer has normally 2 sockets for CPUs; hence, there are 2 CPUs on one node of Supercomputer. Meanwhile, one node of a personal computer has only 1 socket for 1 CPU.
[3] number of processes per node
[4] hour
[5] minute
[6] second
[7] dc-cpu
[8] path to the specific file which needs to be execute on supercomputer
[9] mem521 for standard/slim nodes at PS partition; mem1024 for large nodes at PL partition

--gres=mem512 is by default
-p dc-cpu-bigmem or --gres=mem1024

[3] number of processes per node
[4] hour, max. 23
[5] minute, max. 59
[6] second, max. 59
[7] dc-gpu
[8] path to the specific file which needs to be execute on supercomputer
[9] number of gpus used per node; gres stands for generic resource

#Other notes
--output=out.%j This will create a file with output information in the same directory; j stands for job ID
--error=err.%j This will create a file with error information (if existed) in the same directory; j stands for job ID
